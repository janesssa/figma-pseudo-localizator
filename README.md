# Pseudo Localizator 

Take your design to the next level! 

If you have ever been involved with a software or website translation project, pseudo-localization is a process you will be very familiar with. For those unfamiliar with the term, pseudo-localization is a form of QA testing to determine if your files are ready for translation.  Quite simply, itâ€™s a trial run for the actual translation.

Some guidelines for text expansion/contraction can be found below. Keep in my mind that these numbers are very general and can vary.
